A Java application called Bug Tracking System is used to efficiently find, monitor, and fix  
software bugs during the coding and testing phases of a project. Software development will  
inevitably contain bugs, which, if ignored, can cause delays, poor results, and misunderstandings  
among team members. This system provides a centralized platform for reporting, assigning,  
prioritizing, and tracking bugs until they are fixed. Users such as developers, testers, and project  
managers can use it to generate reports, assign priorities, and modify the status of bugs.  
Java has been used to create the system, taking advantage of its object-oriented design,  
platform independence, and strong support for creating scalable, secure applications. The  
system can utilize technologies such as JSP/Servlets and JDBC for database communication.
